# Mental Health Monitoring System

This project is a mental health monitoring system that uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze audio files and predict the emotional state of the speaker. It has a ReactJS frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend for handling the core functionality. The system provides functionality to store and manage patient data, as well as perform analysis on the collected data.

## Features

- **Emotion Prediction**: The system can analyze audio files and predict the emotional state of the speaker using NLP techniques.
- **Patient Management**: Patients can be added, updated, and deleted from the system. Their personal information and audio files are securely stored.
- **Data Analysis**: The system provides tools to analyze the collected data, including generating reports and visualizations.
- **ReactJS Frontend**: The system has a user-friendly frontend built with ReactJS for interacting with the application.
- **FastAPI Backend**: The backend is built with FastAPI, providing a robust and efficient API for handling requests and data processing.
